This term project is an isometric cafe game where the player is both the server and the chef. The server is controlled with the WASD keys and whose action key is "b" and the “chef”, is the mouse that cooks with buttons being pressed in the correct order. 

To run the project, add cmu_graphics to the folder, open the folder in VScode and run the file “MVC-Cafe Project.py” 

The first two lines of the "toIsometric" function was guided by an online video from the 15-112 course of Fall of 2021. Access to the video is no longer held, but here are the slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10Ai3ksLtZXHL4JyUL0pGqOiqL8JTEEjiDO_nKXiv9GA/edit#slide=id.gf78fa600fd_0_567
